# Machine Learning Concepts

This is a repository to show some of the more interesting algorithms usually developed from scratch as my own implementation of a concept.  

This library is specifically focused on Machine Learning algorithms developed in Python.

All code in this library was developed in iPython notebooks in other projects and copied here for ease of location.  
As such some codes may contain a few bugs.
